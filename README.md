# ECE491 UI/UX Spring 2023
An independent study for UI/UX with Professor Carl Sable at the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Arts

## Project
The only source of food in the building 41 Cooper Square is a small cafeteria called Frankie's, operated by a man of the same name, Frankie Wibowo. The place usually gets crowded during lunch, and the short 10 minute breaks between classes. With only two microwaves and two workers being available even during the peak hours, the fourth floor lounge easily gets filled with those waiting to order, those waiting for their food, those waiting to ask for the price to Venmo, and finally those waiting to get their payment confirmed. Even worse, there is no other way to check the lunch box menus without paying a visit to the cafe. To save each Cooper student's precious time, we hope to create an interface that allows the users to order online (ahead of time), check each day's menu (with a picture, along with nutritional facts), and lastly check the remaining stocks as well.
